# Discontinued
This was one of the first static apps I created that served as a weekend project, and the idea was to help me with my Music shees reading skills by randomly showing a note and the user needing to correctly select the option. No considerations were made about how it behaves in different screen sizes etc and is a static app with no backend, the images are hosted directly from github and this enabled for a free simple static app.

I have learned a lot with this app and the challenges to host it with my limited knowledge at the time, this app help me appreciate the need of a backend framework and deployments. 

The app will be reborn stay tuned for that link will be here!
